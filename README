    Video::Dumper::QuickTime - Dump QuickTime movie file structure

VERSION
    Version 1.0003

SYNOPSIS
        use Video::Dumper::QuickTime;
        my $file = QuickTime->new( -filename => $filename, -progress => \&showProgress );

        eval {$file->Dump ()};
        print "Error during processing: $@\n" if $@;

        my $dumpStr = $file->Result ();

DESCRIPTION
    Video::Dumper::QuickTime parses a QuickTime movie file and generates a
    multi-line string describing the structure of the file.

    The module is intended primarily as a diagnostic tool, although it would
    be possible to subclass Video::Dumper::QuickTime to extract various
    sections of a QuickTime file.
